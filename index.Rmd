## `r if(knitr::is_html_output()) emo::ji("books")` Introduction

IOBR is design for [Immuno-Oncology Biological Research](https://github.com/IOBR/IOBR).
Recent advance in next-generation sequencing has triggered the rapidly accumulating publicly available multi-omics data. The application of integrated omics to exploring robust signatures for clinical translation is increasingly highlighted in immuno-oncology but raises computational and biological challenges. This vignette aims to demonstrate how to utilize the package named IOBR to perform multi-omics immuno-oncology biological research to decode tumor microenvironment and signatures for clinical translation.

This R package integrates 8 published methodologies for decoding tumor microenvironment (TME) contexture: `CIBERSORT`, `TIMER`, `xCell`, `MCPcounter`, `ESITMATE`, `EPIC`, `IPS`, `quanTIseq`. Moreover, 255 published signature gene sets were collected by IOBR, involving tumor microenvironment, tumor metabolism, m6A, exosomes, microsatellite instability, and tertiary lymphoid structure. Run the function `signature_collection_citation` to obtain the source papers, and the function `signature_collection` returns the detail signature genes of all given signatures. Subsequently, IOBR adopts three computational methods to calculate the signature score, comprising `PCA`, `z-score`, and `ssGSEA`. To note, IOBR collected and employed multiple approaches for variable transition, visualization, batch survival analysis, feature selection, and statistical analysis. Batch analysis and visualization of corresponding results are supported. The details of how IOBR works are described below.
