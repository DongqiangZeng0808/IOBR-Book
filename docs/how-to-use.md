   * `anno_eset()`: annotate an ExpressionSet object (eset) with gene symbols using the provided annotation data.  It retains only the rows with probes that have matching identifiers in the annotation data. The function handles duplicates according to the specified method. The output is an annotated and cleaned expression set.
